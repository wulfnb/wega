# layout/core

**Status: PLANNED — NOT IMPLEMENTED**

## Purpose

Layout tree, constraints and fragment output shared by all formatting contexts.

## Intended responsibilities

- Box/fragment tree and layout constraints
- Formatting-context dispatch

## Expected dependencies

`std` only for now (`foundation/*` deferred). Independent contract with plain input/output types: no dependency on `css/*`, `dom/*` or `graphics/*`; an adapter converts style and DOM data (precedent: `stylo_taffy` inside Blitz).

## Dependencies to avoid

`css/*`, `dom/*`, `graphics/*`, `javascript/*`, `services/*`, `adapters/*`; Blitz, Taffy or Parley types in public APIs.

## Current status

PLANNED — NOT IMPLEMENTED. This directory is a placeholder created in migration Phase 1. It contains no code, no `Cargo.toml`, and is not part of any Cargo workspace. See `docs/architecture/module-map.md`.
